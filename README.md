# CS361-Microservice

## How to Request Data

We need to make sure the applications are running 
The button would need to be clicked and that button this message "Get Quote" for the reciever to read it 
Example:

## How to Recieve Data

Read the "Get Quote" then fetch the quote from an online API which generates random quotes 
Example:

## Shutting down the microservice

the send file would automatically shut done but for the recieve file once the quote is generated and sent out, a return function would be implemented.
